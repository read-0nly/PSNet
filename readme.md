## PSNET : A really bad idea

Basically, what if we abused **iex (iwr $url).content** to make a living toolkit you interact with directly online?

Instead of having to carry scripts between computers, you can just call **iex (iwr $url).content**, and just remember the URL

From there you have access to the whole toolkit and it's always the latest version.
